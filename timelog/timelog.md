## Week 16

### Sat 07/01/23
- **1 hour** looking into what data to download and use.
- **2 hours** looking up ways to download PDF files using a script. (Ended up using a readily available script found online)
- **2 hours** looking into ways to read PDB files and writing code to extract the sequence of a protein from a PDB file.
- **0.5 hour** writing code for generating the target array (need to go through this with supervisor) from the amino acid sequence.

## Week 17 (Start of Sem 2)

### Mon 09/01/23 & Tue 10/01/23
- **1 hour** reading on ways to encode an amino acid sequence for machine learning.
- **3 hours** writing code for automatically creating the data that will be used for training including the input data and the target for every data point.
- **3 hours** Creating a custom dataset using dummy data and training a basic CNN.
- **3 hours** Writing the data in a suitable format to be read during training, fixing small bug issues, attempting to properly train a network.

### Thu 12/01/23
- **1 hour** Reading PyTorch documentation to implement an RNN (as well as GRU and LSTM)
- **1 hour** Reading RNN theory
- **1 hour** Reading some background on protein domain boundary prediction (Res-Dom)

### Fri 13/01/23
