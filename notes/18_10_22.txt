, which discusses ways of identifying protein domains using various methods.
This is needed in order to identify the protein domains from AlphaFold predictions.

Questions:
- Which one to use?
- If I use a non-perfect technique, won't the accuracy of AlphaFold's protein domain prediction be underestimated?
- Will that be an issue or is it okay if it is just mentioned as a limitation of my results?
- Doesn't CATH also use such a technique? Should the technique used with .pdf files be similar with CATH's ?
