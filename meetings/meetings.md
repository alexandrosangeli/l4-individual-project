# Supervisor meetings

## 04/10/22

### Questions
- How will the project be different from FUpred (Folding Unit Predictor) ? (from W. Zheng et al)
  - Not a clear answer but contact maps could be looked into as part of the project.
- What exactly are we predicting?
  - The domain that amino acids belong to. For example, input data could be "A,E,S,L,E,L,S..." and the output "D1,D1,D1,D2,D2,D2,D2..".
- What is the input data? Contact information? (from paper)
  - A sequence of amino acids could be the input data. Contact maps can be looked into and be utilised in the project.
- Ask for email to add to GitLab/GitHub.
- Ask if timelog format looks okay.
- Does the structure of the repository matter? (template on Moodle?)
- Is the server necessary?
  - Depends on what we what to emphasize on - i.e. Machine Learning only or a combination of software engineering and Machine Learning.

### Minutes
- Went over proteins - structures, domains, disordered proteins etc.
- Discussed GraphQL and how building a Django server could be part of the project.
- Protein Domain prediction is not *really* solved yet, there could be some different methods and techniques that could be used.
- As a L4 project, it doesn't have to be very unique (and would also be difficult to make something very unique), so approaches found in literature could be used.
- Next meeting: Monday 10th, 14:30-15:30.
